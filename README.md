# Landing-page

This is the main page for my DJ website, showcasing the music I have made and offering free downloads of the tracks to other DJ's.

The main site features a 'mailing list' sign up form created with Bootstrap and edited to fit the styling of the page.
This user form will capture a name and email, and using FormSpree will directly email me the results.

The social links in the nav bar are linked to all of my social media and music sites, the Soundcloud tracks embedded from SOundcloud Directly.

The 'free tracks' page takes an array of images, and links and renders the free download buttons and styles around these.
The user can click the download button to download my tracks from the GitHub pages repository directly. 

This is an on-going project, and ideas for future enhancements would be incorporating the SoundCloud API and possible BeatPort API to show new music which are making their way into my up-coming sets.
